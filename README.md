This is the readme for my personal portfolio. I created it using Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have found that creating a portfolio for myself is a lot of difficult than creating other types of projects. I am really happy with the outcome though!

## Summary of Application

When a user first opens my portfolio they are greated with my logo and a headline about myself. The user can interact with the logo and headline by moving their cursor around. I have always liked interactive things like that so I wanted to include it in my portfolio. The user can scroll down and view my most recent projects. Further down the page are little blerbs about what makes me a good developer.

All of my examples are displayed as thumbnails on the my work page. When a user hovers over on of the images they can see the project name and what languages were used to create the project.

Each project has it's own individual route with a unique background that goes with the project. Users can read more about the projects, click on live links, visit the github repos for the projects, and view screenshots.

I wanted to keep the about page simple because what I really wanted to showcase were my projects.

The contact page is also simple in style with just my email address and a contact form
